<p>Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). 
Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court.
 The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return</p>

<p>Historians believe that the game's ancient origin lay in 12th century northern France, where a ball was struck with the palm of the hand.[2]
 Louis X of France was a keen player of jeu de paume ("game of the palm"), which evolved into real tennis, and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style</p>

The components of a tennis racket include a handle, known as the grip, connected to a neck which joins a roughly elliptical frame that holds a matrix of tightly pulled strings.
 For the first 100 years of the modern game, rackets were made of wood and of standard size, and strings were of animal gut.
